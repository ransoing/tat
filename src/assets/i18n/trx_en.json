As he spoke with her, he learned that her friend’s older boyfriend was trying to force her into prostitution. After she had refused and argued with him, he dumped her in the parking lot and sped off.</p><p>She was cold, exhausted, had no money, no identification, was carrying everything she owned in her arms and was desperate to get back home to Las Vegas. At that point, Arian told her, “I will find a way to get you home.” After getting her warm and giving her water to drink, Arian looked at one of the two TAT stickers prominently displayed on his window (which the victim had been eye-level with when she knocked on his door) and called the National Human Trafficking Hotline.</p><p>They worked with him to secure the woman shelter for the night, a pre-paid cab ride to get her to that shelter and a chaperoned train ride back to Las Vegas the next day, where she was reunited with a family member. Arian took care of the young women until she was placed in the cab, and even gave her his personal cell phone number in case she needed anything else.</p>",

According to the incident report, officers were called to the scene at 3:20 p.m. and were allowed inside the RV by the occupants, who said they were in the area on vacation and to visit Sorenson’s daughter. The officers, however, observed that the alleged victim appeared frightened and exhibited signs of malnutrition. A State Police trooper took the young woman outside, where she began to weep and beg the trooper not to let her return to the RV. She told the trooper she was being held against her will and had been abused sexually and physically by the suspects. She also said the suspects threatened to kill or injure her family. She said she had infections all over her body and couldn’t remember the last time she had anything to eat or drink, adding that several days had passed.",

He was filling out his paper work, when he noticed a man going back and forth from the RV to the convenience store. He also noticed different men knocking on the door of the RV, but it was when he saw a young woman try to stick her head out the window only to have it violently snapped back, a black curtain pulled in its place and a commotion ensue inside that Kevin made a phone call that resulted in the state trooper coming out.</p><p>According to the incident report, officers were called to the scene at 3:20 p.m. and were allowed inside the RV by the occupants, Laura Sorensen and Aldair Hodza, who said they were in the area on vacation and to visit Sorensen’s daughter.

She also said no one back home in Iowa considered her missing, since the suspects forced her to communicate with family members, telling them that nothing out of the ordinary was taking place. According to the report, she later told a State Police investigator she was forced to perform oral sex on Hodza, whom she called “John,” and another unknown male that same day inside the RV at the truck stop parking lot.</p><p>Today, thanks to Kevin’s call, that young woman is at home with her family in Clive, IA … and Laura Sorensen and Aldair Hodza were sentenced to 40 and 41 years in prison, respectively.</p>",

After William told the girl he was not interested, he observed her knocking on the doors of several other trucks before getting into one. During this time, William also saw an adult man walking around the lot and noticed that he appeared to be watching the girl closely.</p><p>Since William had received training from Truckers Against Trafficking, he recognized the signs of a potential trafficking situation and knew to call 911 first before making a call to the National Human Trafficking Hotline to report the situation. After collecting information from William about the situation he observed, the Hotline Advocate also made a report to the Hotline’s trusted law enforcement contacts in the area, who were able to coordinate with the local police in their investigation.</p>",
