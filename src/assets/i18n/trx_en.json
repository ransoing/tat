Instead, he found himself picking vegetables for less than $30 a day and worked to the limits of endurance.</p>\n<p>His boss, a man named Salvador Hernandez, oversaw a crew of migrant workers. He hired them in Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley. Then he drove them across the country and shuffled them from farm to farm and state to state: Mississippi, Florida and up the Eastern Seaboard. They traveled in old school buses so crowded that some of the workers sat on the floor.</p>\n<p>Lunch breaks were rare, as were days off. Those who defied Hernandez were sometimes beaten. The injured were often left to suffer. Yet no one fled. At night, the crew shared floor space in cramped quarters infested with rats and cockroaches. By day, Hernandez pushed them ruthlessly beneath the summer sun, brandishing a pistol at those who slowed down, according to workers' accounts and court records. Hernandez kept a gun in plain view in his lap when workers came to collect their pay, according to the court case and worker interviews. He often withheld their wages, and he threatened to call immigration authorities if any dared to complain.</p>\n<p>It took Jimenez Luna three years to muster the courage to escape. By then, he was picking sweet corn in central New York. With help from a grassroots labor organization, he fled to San Antonio, where he had relatives.</p>\n<p>He and three other laborers filed a civil complaint in federal court and, in 2013, won a $2.45 million judgment for back wages against Hernandez, the labor boss’ wife and his brother.</p>"
